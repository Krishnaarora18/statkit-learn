# Statkit-learn

- **Statkit-learn** is a lightweight machine learning library built from scratch using NumPy by me for learning and practice.
- It is designed as an **educational**, minimal, and fully transparent implementation of **ML algorithms**.

---

## Currently included

**Linear Regression Algorithms**

- GDRegressor
- SGDRegressor
- RidgeRegressor
- LassoRegressor

**Preprocessing**

- OutliersRemover
- StandardScaler

More Models will be added as soon as i learn them

## Features

- Fully built over NumPy no other dependencies
- Simple, clean, easy-to-read implementations
- Reproducible Code and Logic
- Beginner-friendly codebase

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Krishnaarora18/statkit-learn.git
cd statkit-learn
```

## How to use?

- import the model class.

```python
from statkitlearn.linear_model import RidgeRegressor
from statkitlearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```
- more explaination about how to use each class is inside the particular module's README.md file
- for example:- GDRegressor usage guide is available in the README file of linear_model module
